2022.1.24: I have checked the middle results for labeled journals (whitelisted or not) and unpaywall journals. I added the missed website folders to both data (there was mistake in code, so some websites might be missed) in the release folder in the development folder. I also saved the original data (missing some folders) in the data drive and the data for fill those missed folders, but cannot find all because some urls didn't work. I also put css files into middle results (website htmls) folders.
2022.1.25: I just found css files are missing in the scraped missed websites folder. I need to add that to the folders. I figure that some gray oa journals from category B, C and L having unclear reasons. will remove them.
2022.1.26 Moved css files to middle result for labeled data and  added missed websites.
2022.1.27 run the feature extractor on labeled journal websites and unpaywall. Will need to add data imputation and abstract feature to stack models and then do bibilimterics features.
